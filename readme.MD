My first JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors project was a simple game that allowed users to play against the computer via a website. 

Learnt: .querySelector || .querySelectorAll() || .forEach() || .addEventListener || .getElementById || recap on creating functions, arrays, if statements.

[UPCOMING!]The game had a clean and minimalistic interface with buttons for the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

***GAME IS PLAYABLE WITHOUT ANY CSS DECORS****
